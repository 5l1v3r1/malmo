To build wheel
--------------

On Linux or MacOS: .\linux_macos_wheel.sh
On Windows: windows_wheel.bat

Publishing
----------

The (binary) "linux" platform tag is not supported by pypi.org. 
Rename "linux" to "manylinux1" for now. The manylinux2010 PEP 571 is being worked on now.

(cd dist; mv malmo*.whl `ls | sed 's/-linux_/-manylinux1_/'`)

On Ubuntu16.4:

Avoid the apt-get installed twine - use the python3 latest.

pip3 install twine
python3
>> import twine 
>> help(twine)
Note install location and >> exit()

On Linux: 

python3 /$HOME/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/twine/__main__.py upload  --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ package/dist/*

Installing
----------

pip3 install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ malmo
